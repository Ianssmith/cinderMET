# VISUALIZATION OF DATA FROM THE PICTURING MATH EXHIBITION AT THE MET MUSEUM
### By Kim KÃ¶hler and Ian Smith

------

Our goal was originally to create a 3 dimensional timeline with the objects created from the data. 
But during the project we re-evaluated the shape of just a line. It didn't feel interesting or immersive.
Thus, we decided to create a more abstract shape of the data. A shape based on the 4 sides of a cube, one category is mapped on one side of the cube. The objects are placed one after the other on the Y axis, while the Z and X is mapped after the data. This we succeded to complete.

Our secondary main goal was to be able to reshape the form by clicking on different buttons containing the data categories. We came close to completing this, but we are stuck in one specific event. We have commented it in the code.

The third goal was to be able to click on every object, using a 3D picking tool. When clicked, more data would show in a dropdown at the same time as a picture of the object appeared on the side. We got the dropdowns working, but not integrated into the 3D tool.

Please don't be confused by our video with a 2D view. We are only showcasing it to show how far we got on data handling and the dropdowns, as we didn't succeed in integrating them into the 3D picking tool. The 3D view is our main project.

Even though we do not have a finalized and brushed up project, we hope that you can see that we both worked a huge amount of time on this project. We really spent a lot of time to try to get this to work. And even though we didn't succeed, we learnt a lot and pushed ourselves in areas of coding that was new and challenging to us.
